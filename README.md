# 🤖 Chatbot Production

Welcome to the **Chatbot Production** repository! This project showcases a production-ready AI chatbot that seamlessly integrates text and image inputs, featuring secure authentication, session tracking, and Dockerized deployment. Built on a modular Flask architecture, it's designed for both experimental exploration and production environments.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Chatbot Production system offers:

- **Multimodal Interaction**: Supports both text and image inputs for a rich user experience.
- **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes JWT tokens to ensure secure user access.
- **Session Management**: Maintains user-specific conversation histories for personalized interactions.
- **Modular Design**: Organized codebase with distinct components for authentication, AI processing, and routing.
- **Testing Suite**: Includes unit tests for critical functionalities to ensure reliability.
- **Docker Integration**: Simplifies deployment with Docker, ensuring consistency across environments.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Text and Image Processing**: Leverages advanced AI models to process and respond to both text and image inputs.
- **JWT Authentication**: Implements token-based authentication to safeguard user sessions.
- **Persistent Sessions**: Tracks user interactions across sessions for a personalized experience.
- **Modular Architecture**: Codebase is divided into clear modules for easy navigation and contribution.
- **Automated Testing**: Ensures code reliability with a comprehensive suite of unit tests.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Facilitates easy deployment and scaling using Docker.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for backend development.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the chatbot's API endpoints.
- **OpenAI/Hugging Face**: AI models for natural language processing and image recognition.
- **PyJWT**: Library for implementing JWT authentication.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions, managing user sessions and data.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for consistent deployment environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## 🚦 Getting Started

To set up and run the chatbot locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nick00404/chatbot_production.git
   cd chatbot_production
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary configurations, such as API keys and secret keys.

5. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the Chatbot**:

   Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser to interact with the chatbot.

## 🧪 Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- **Interact via Web Interface**: Use the provided frontend to chat with the bot.
- **Access API Endpoints**: Send POST requests to `/api/chat` with JSON payloads containing `text` or `image` data to receive responses.

## 🧪 Testing

To run the test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

Ensure that all tests pass before making contributions.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- **Multilingual Support**: Implement language translation capabilities for global users.
- **Advanced AI Features**: Integrate more sophisticated AI models for enhanced responses.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard to monitor user interactions and chatbot performance.
- **Mobile Application**: Create a mobile app for easier access to the chatbot.
